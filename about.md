I'm a Computer Science student currently working towards my degree at Emory University. There are maybe a few too many things I find interesting, some of them will be listed and explored on this site. 

This is my personal blog and website. Here there should be an updated copy of my CV and links to contact me. I might occasionally post about things I find interesting.
