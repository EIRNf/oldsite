Hi my name is Esteban. I am a programmer currently working at NCR Corporation. I graduated from Emory University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and an Applied Math Minor in Dec 2019. This site is supposed to stand as a simple place to showcase my work and stuff I am up to or whatever I find interesting really.

## About this site
This website is built ontop of the [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). I easily recommend [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as a framework to build static sites with, it is simply a pleasure to work with.

[Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) was made by the fantastic developer [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). 

A lot of this websites layout was also inspired and built similar to the personal website of [Chris Schuld](https://chrisschuld.com/), go check out his awesome blog posts. I do recommend checking specifically his blog post on using [Jekyll with Docker](https://chrisschuld.com/2019/02/building-your-own-website-in-jekyll/), it definitely made the process a lot easier for myself.
