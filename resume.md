# Esteban Ignacio Ramos 

Education
---------
2016-2019
:   **BSc, Computer Science**; 
Emory University

    *Minor: Applied Mathematics*

Experience
----------
**NCR Corporation, Atlanta Georgia, USA:**

Software Engineer

* I will begin working as a Software Engineer with NCR Corporation starting in mid February

**Verint Systems, Atlanta, Georgia, USA**

Software Engineering Intern

* Developed a RESTful API in Java that facilitated querying of internal status information of a complex integration component in a largely self led project that was pushed into production after completion.

* Implemented unit testing (JUnit, Mockito) and gained exposure to  Jenkins automation

* Caught a technical bug that misreported information of internal components

Programming Skills
--------------------
* Languages:
    * Java
    * SQL
    * C

* Frameworks:  
    * Git

 Relevant Coursework
--------------------
*  Systems Programming, Mathematical Modeling, Computer Security, Database Systems, Assembly Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Cryptography, Numerical Analysis

Programming Projects
--------------------

[MCM/ICM: The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling(COMAP)](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html)	
:   Outstanding Winner

* Competed with Emily Rexer and Ishan Saran in the [MCM/ICM 2019](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2019/results/) and chosen as one of the 19 Outstanding Winners out of 11,000 participating teams

* Tasked with the creation of a mathematical computational model and the writing of a [twenty-page paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fkptkhyypfmc) over a period of four days

* Paper published in the [Fall 2019 Edition of the UMAP Journal](https://www.comap.com/product/?idx=1667)

Undergraduate Raspberry PI Computer Cluster 
: Founder		Co-Founders: Simon Marty, Emily Rexer, Yi Wang

* Received funding from the [Emory Techlab](https://it.emory.edu/studentdigitallife/study_production_spaces/tech-lab/index.html) to design and  build a Raspberry PI Cluster to provide to the general student body a low cost/low risk tool to learn about distributed computing and Kubernetes

* Integrated the cluster with the Emory network to provide secure remote access to Kubernetes anywhere on campus

Distributed Systems Research
: Undergraduate Researcher
* Worked with [Dr. Arnold](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~darnold/) of Emory University on research exploring the simulation of distributed system programs in order to develop better prediction methods to estimate  HPC program runtime

* Current project utilizes a framework built on LogGOPSim to simulate the runtime of programs under different conditions within 5% of accuracy 

* Working on a C++ project that generates generic samples of distributed systems program motifs/designs


Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

* Human Languages:

     * Spanish (native)
     * English (fluent)

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
