2019
:   [MCM/ICM: The Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling(COMAP)](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/index.html);
Outstanding Winner
* Competed with Emily Rexer and Ishan Saran in the [MCM/ICM 2019](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/contests/2019/results/) and chosen as one of the 19 Outstanding Winners out of 11,000 participating teams
* Tasked with the creation of a mathematical computational model and the writing of a [twenty-page paper](https://www.overleaf.com/read/fkptkhyypfmc) over a period of four days
* Paper published in the [Fall 2019 Edition of the UMAP Journal](https://www.comap.com/product/?idx=1667)

2019
:   Undergraduate Raspberry PI Computer Cluster;
Founder		Co-Founders: Simon Marty, Emily Rexer, Yi Wang
* Received funding from the [Emory Techlab](https://it.emory.edu/studentdigitallife/study_production_spaces/tech-lab/index.html) to design and  build a Raspberry PI Cluster to provide to the general student body a low cost/low risk tool to learn about distributed computing and Kubernetes
* Integrated the cluster with the Emory network to provide secure remote access to Kubernetes anywhere on campus

2019
:   Distributed Systems Research;
Undergraduate Researcher
* Worked with [Dr. Arnold](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~darnold/) of Emory University on research exploring the simulation of distributed system programs in order to develop better prediction methods to estimate  HPC program runtime
* Current project utilizes a framework built on LogGOPSim to simulate the runtime of programs under different conditions within 5% of accuracy 
* Working on a C++ project that generates generic samples of distributed systems program motifs/designs
